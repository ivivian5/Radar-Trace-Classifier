How to Run:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    python3 main.py
    
(Note) needs user input for whether to use default 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Assumptions:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    likelihood file has 2 lines of data comprised of only floats and voids
    ...............................................................................
    training file has 20 lines of data comprised of only floats and voids where
    first 10 lines are bird data and last 10 lines are plane data
    ...............................................................................
    testing file has 10 lines of data comprised of only floats and voids

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Files:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Radar_Trace.py - Uses the training data to make new likelihoods for the
                model and then Naive Bayesian Classification to classify each line
                of velocities in the testing file
    ...............................................................................
        main.py - Prompts user for input for files to read and runs the classifier
                to classify a classification for each of the 10 lines of the
                testing file

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution Structure:

The Radar Trace Classifier first makes a new likelihood function using the training
data given by computing the means and standard deviations for the velocities within
a window. Then the standard deviations are all binned into 0.5 size bins before
computing the probability of a given standard deviation of being in the bin and
storing as our likelihood function.

This model is then used to classify each line of the testing data as bird or plane.
For each window of velocities in the testing data, apart from the very first 
(which has no prior) the transition probability is applied to the previous
probability saved. Then, it calculates the new likelihood (product between the 
likelihood of the mean velocity occurring, which is given in the likelihood files,
and the new likelihood of the standard deviation occurring) of being a bird and
being a plane. The likelihood is multiplied because mean and standard deviation are
independent of each other. This likelihood is then multiplied to the prior before
normalized and compared to classify the velocities as coming from a bird or a
plane. After applying this to the state of every window of velocities in the line
given, the final classification of the line is found as the solution.

The window size I went with was 150 velocities which results in 100% accuracy.
Note: The extra velocities that do not make up a full window is added to the 
last window.
